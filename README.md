# Brute-Force-PIN-Cracker
A Python script simulating a brute-force attack to guess a randomly generated 4-digit PIN code. The script iterates through all possible PIN combinations (0000-9999) and checks each one against a mock system. Once the correct PIN is guessed, it displays the successful attempt and exits. Perfect for learning about brute-force algorithms.
